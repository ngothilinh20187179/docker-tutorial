# Volume
Docker volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers, ensuring that data remains intact even after the containers themselves are stopped or removed. 

## Why Use Docker Volumes?
- Data Persistence: Keep your database or user files safe even if the container is deleted.
- Data Sharing: Multiple containers can access and share the same data volume.
- Hot Reloading: Map your source code into the container to see changes instantly without rebuilding the image.

## Key Commands and Usage
```bash
# List all volumes.
docker volume ls

# Create a new volume.
docker volume create <name>

# Remove all unused local volumes.
docker volume prune
```

```bash
# Named Volumes
docker run -v my_data:/var/lib/mysql mysql

# Bind Mounts
docker run -v $(pwd):/app nginx
```

## Practice
Hot Reloading & Logs from containers
❌ Dockerfile
❌ Rebuild image/ Run Container

Run
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name web-volume-test \
  -p 8081:80 \
  -v "$(pwd)/index.html:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html" \
  -v "$(pwd)/web_logs:/var/log/nginx" \
  nginx:alpine
```
- Bind Mount
- Image: nginx:alpine
- Container: web-volume-test
- Port Mapping: Opens a 'window' from port 8081 to port 80 inside the container where Nginx is waiting.
- Volume (File): Grabs the index.html file in the current directory (pwd) and overrides it in the correct position Nginx reads the file to display the web.
- Volume (Folder): Connects the web_logs folder on the real machine to the folder containing Nginx's logs. Everything Nginx writes will appear on your computer.

Edit code index.html & Check browser
```bash
localhost:8080
```

Delete container and check web_logs
```bash
docker rm -f web-volume-test
```
